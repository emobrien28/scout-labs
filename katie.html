            <p class="blog-post-meta">January 1, 2014 </p>

                <h3>What have you been learning in science class this week? </h3>
                    <p>I learned about the butterflies. We have been growing some and keep them in cups in the corner of Mr. Hulsey’s classroom. In the beginning they were some caterpillars and it was boring because they went into the cocoons for a long time. We put some food for them and saw them poop which was gross. I didn’t like that part. Some of them also died and Andrew cried because his died. Mine didn’t die because I fed him well and didn’t shake the cup too much. Except then this week after lunch, they came out of their brown cocoon’s. I think they were changing in there. I drew some pictures and watched it fly. Mr. Hulsey says the butterfly is the same caterpillar from the beginning, but I am still not sure, because caterpillars are brown and fluffy, and butterflies have wings and are orange with spots. I’m still thinking but Mr. Hulsey says that’s ok. </p>
